# JavaScript Event Loop

## Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Programming

In this synchronous code, the actions happen sequentially. Each line executes one after the other, in the order they appear in the code.

Example: Imagine a chef working in a kitchen.

```js
console.log(“Start”);
console.log(“Chopping vegetables…”);
console.log(“Finished chopping vegetables.”);
console.log(“Serve the dish.”);
console.log(“End”);
```

will print

```console
Start
Chopping vegetables…
Finished chopping vegetables.
Serve the dish.
End
```

In this asynchronous code, tasks can overlap and occur independently. Multiple task executions can occur concurrently.

Example:

```js
console.log(“Start”);
setTimeout(() => {
 console.log(“Timer done.”);
}, 2000);
console.log(“Continue with other tasks…”);
console.log(“End”);
```

will print

```console
Start
Continue with other tasks…
End
Timer done.
```

In this asynchronous code, we use `setTimeout` to simulate a time delay.  
JavaScript's event loop enables this multitasking capability by efficiently handling asynchronous operations, ensuring that your web applications remain responsive and efficient, even when dealing with numerous tasks simultaneously.

## Some Common Asynchronous APIs

1. `fetch`
2. `setTimeout`
3. `setInterval`
4. Promise

## What is Event Loop?

> The event loop concept is very simple. There's an endless loop, where the JavaScript engine waits for tasks, executes them and then sleeps, waiting for more tasks.

The event loop is responsible to keep a JavaScript program responsive and efficient.

## Why do we need event loop?

JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language. It can handle single task execution at a time.

## Call stack

A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

- When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
- Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
- When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
- If the stack takes up more space than it was assigned, a "stack overflow" error is thrown.

```js
function greeting() {
  // [1] Some code here
  sayHi();
  // [2] Some code here
}
function sayHi() {
  return 'Hi!';
}

// Invoke the `greeting` function
greeting();

// [3] Some code here
```

Call stack:

```console
- sayHi
- greeting
```

## Task and Task Queue

A task queue is a set of tasks.
Task queues are sets, not queues, because the event loop processing model grabs the first runnable task from the chosen queue, instead of dequeuing the first task.

## Microtask, Microtask Queue and `queueMicrotask()`

Each event loop has a microtask queue, which is a queue of microtasks, initially empty. A microtask is a colloquial way of referring to a task that was created via the queue a microtask algorithm.

## Queue Priority

The microtask queue is prioritized over task queue.

## Event loop schedule

Immediately after every task, the engine executes all tasks from microtask queue, prior to running any other tasks or rendering or anything else.
All microtasks are completed before any other event handling or rendering or any other macrotask takes place.
If we'd like to execute a function asynchronously (after the current code), but before changes are rendered or new events handled, we can schedule it with queueMicrotask.

So the event loop algorithm works in this sequence:

1. Execute the first runnable task from the task queue.
2. Execute all microtask in the microtask queue.
3. Render changes if any.
4. Execute the first runnable task from the task queue or wait for it.

## Challenges

```js
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(1));

setTimeout(() => console.log(2), 0);

queueMicrotask(() => {
  console.log(3);
  queueMicrotask(() => console.log(4));
});

console.log(5);
```

```js
(() => {
  console.log('this is the start');

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Callback 1: this is a msg from call back');
  }); // has a default time value of 0

  console.log('this is just a message');

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Callback 2: this is a msg from call back');
  }, 0);

  console.log('this is the end');
})();
```

      <li>"Callback 2: this is a msg from call back"</li>

```js
console.log(1);

setTimeout(() => console.log(2));

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(3));

Promise.resolve().then(() => setTimeout(() => console.log(4)));

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(5));

setTimeout(() => console.log(6));

console.log(7);
```
