# React Compound Component Pattern

The Compound Component Pattern in React allows you to create components that work together to provide a more flexible and reusable API. This pattern is particularly useful for building UI components like tabs, accordions, and dropdowns.

## What is the Compound Component Pattern?

The Compound Component Pattern involves creating a parent component that manages the state and behavior, while child components are used to render the UI. The child components communicate with the parent component to access shared state and behavior.

## Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Allows users to compose components in various ways.
- **Reusability**: Encourages the reuse of components across different parts of an application.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separates logic from presentation.

## Example: Accordion

Let's create an accordion using the Compound Component Pattern.

### Step 1: Create the Accordion Component with context

```typescript
import React, { useState, createContext, ReactNode } from 'react';

type AccordionContextType = {
  openIndex: number | null;
  setOpenIndex: (index: number | null) => void;
};

const AccordionContext = createContext<AccordionContextType | undefined>(
  undefined
);

type AccordionProps = {
  children: ReactNode;
};

export const Accordion = ({ children }: AccordionProps) => {
  const [openIndex, setOpenIndex] = useState<number | null>(null);

  return (
    <AccordionContext.Provider value={{ openIndex, setOpenIndex }}>
      <div>{children}</div>
    </AccordionContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

### Step 2: Create AccordionItem Component

```typescript
import React, { useContext } from 'react';

type AccordionItemProps = {
  index: number;
  children: ReactNode;
};

export const AccordionItem = ({ index, children }: AccordionItemProps) => {
  const context = useContext(AccordionContext);

  if (!context) {
    throw new Error('AccordionItem must be used within an Accordion');
  }

  const { openIndex, setOpenIndex } = context;
  const isOpen = openIndex === index;

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setOpenIndex(isOpen ? null : index)}>
        {isOpen ? 'Close' : 'Open'}
      </button>
      {isOpen && <div>{children}</div>}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Step 3: Use the Accordion

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { Accordion, AccordionItem } from './Accordion';

const App = () => (
  <Accordion>
    <AccordionItem index={0}>
      <p>Content for item 1</p>
    </AccordionItem>
    <AccordionItem index={1}>
      <p>Content for item 2</p>
    </AccordionItem>
  </Accordion>
);

export default App;
```

## Conclusion

The Compound Component Pattern is a powerful way to build flexible and reusable components in React. By separating logic and presentation, you can create components that are easy to use and maintain.
