# Definition

Button is a clickable interactive element that triggers a response.

You can place text and icons inside of a button.

Buttons are often used for form submissions and to toggle elements into view.

## Usage

The component comes in different variants such as `primary`, `secondary`, `large` and `small` which you can use to alter the look and feel of the button.

## Inputs

Button has the following properties:

<Controls />

<Source
  code={`const thisIsCustomSource = true;
if (isSyntaxHighlighted) {
  console.log('syntax highlighting is working');
}`}
/>

<Markdown>
{`# A header

<div>Some text</div>

The example above will remain as-is in plain markdown, but MDX2 will compile it to:

# A header

<div>
  <p>Some text</p>
</div>`}
</Markdown>
